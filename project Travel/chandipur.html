        <p>Simlipal National Park</p>
        <img id="simlipalnatpark" src="https://www.holidify.com/images/compressed/attractions/attr_98.jpg?v=1.1">
        <p>Reflecting the natural beauty of an era gone by, Simlipal National Park is in a beautiful and scenic town in Odisha. Situated in Mayurbhanj, it once used to be a hunting ground for the rulers of the province. Simlipal is the largest wildlife sanctuary in India and is also considered as one of the principal tiger projects in India. The area is rich with dense forests, striking meadows, startling waterfalls and beautiful rivers. It is blessed with great bio-diversity and huge varieties of fauna that make it a great place to engage in wildlife sightseeing! Simlipal Reserve is home to more than 1000 varieties of plants. It has around 96 species of orchids that are endemic to the forest. Baripada is the nearest town to Simlipal and can be considered a gateway to the same.

Reach Simlipal National Park and check into the forest rest house. Hire a jeep for a safari and set out into the forest to enjoy the beauty of nature and exploring the wild. After the safari, return to the rest house and go to a nearby restaurant to enjoy the local cuisine of the place. A trip to the park is best combined with Khichling or any other nearby town such as Chandipur, Bhubhaneshwar, Puri, Konark etc.
The next day you can go for an excursion to any of these places via a bus or jeep. Private buses and shared Jeeps are available for Khiching, Jashipur which is on NH-6 20 kms from Simlipal.</p><br>

        <p>Chandipur Beach</p>
        <img id="chandipurbeach" src="https://www.holidify.com/images/compressed/1509.jpg">
        <p>Chandipur Beach is a phenomenal beach that glorifies the beauty of the state of Orissa, 'phenomenal' being the keyword. Would you believe it if you were told that the beach is not a continuously existing feature on the map? That the sea disappears during the day? Well, as unbelievable as it sounds, it is actually true! They call it the "Hide and Seek sea", and rightly so! Watching the sea disappear and miraculously reappear as it plays with you is an unforgettable experience that will leave you in awe of the miracles of nature.

One of nature's truly wondrous works is how the sea at this beach recedes up to five kilometres during the ebb, and then comes back to fill the emptiness with the high tide. This literally gives us the opportunity to walk deep into the actual seabed. In fact, when you walk on the beach when it has receded, only your feet get submerged into the shallow water and get surrounded by moist sand; so if you take a picture from afar, it looks as if you are actually walking on water.</p><br>

        <p>Panchaligeswar Shrine</p>
        <img id="panchaligeswar" src="https://www.holidify.com/images/compressed/1510.jpg">
        <p>Panchalingeshwar, covered with the green belt shielded over Nilagiri Hills, is located around 45km from Chandipur. It is popular for the Shiva shrine as this place is dedicated to 5 statues of Lord Shiva which are placed over a perennial stream.

This is exciting for adventurous people as this place is ideal for trekking. If you need one night stay then Odisha tourism department has provided a Panthasala.</p><br>

        style="width: 35%">
        <p>Remuna is 25km away from Chandipur, is famous for the shrine of Khirachora Gopinath. It is a seat for Vaishnavite culture from centuries.. Khira (a special milk preparation) is the most delicious offering of the temple.

Champak and Kadamba trees fill the air with sweet and scented fragrance all the time. If you are looking for inner peace then this is the place for you.</p><br>
