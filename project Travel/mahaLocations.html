      Udaipur, also known as the City of Lakes, is the crown jewel of the state of Rajasthan. It is surrounded by the beautiful Aravalli Hills in all directions, making this city as lovely as it is. This 'Venice of the East' has an abundance of natural beauty, mesmerising temples and breathtaking architecture which makes it a must-visit destination in India.  A boat ride through the serene waters of Lake Pichola will be enough to prove to you why Udaipur is the pride of Rajasthan.

Located in a valley and surrounded by four lakes, Udaipur has natural offerings with a grandeur multiplied by human effort, to make it one of the most enchanting and memorable tourist destinations. It justifies all names ever offered to its charm from 'Jewel of Mewar' to 'Venice of the East'. And though the entire city's architecture is flattering, the Lake Palace hotel is something that offers the city a visual definition. The revered Nathdwara temple is about 60 km from Udaipur.

Climb on to the camel saddle and make your way through this desert or camp under the night sky in this golden land for an unforgettable experience.
The Jaisalmer Fort stands as a citadel and is surrounded by narrow alleys inhabited by people residing there for generations. With shops selling colourful handicrafts and havelis that will make you travel back in time, Jaisalmer is an amalgam of exotic Indian desert culture, heritage and adventure.

    <p>
      The only hill station of Rajasthan, its cool atmosphere and lush green surroundings make it a major tourist spot within the state. The most important attraction, however, are undoubtedly the Dilwara temples, which is one of the most stunning piece of architecture in the country. If you are a history or architecture buff, this is one of the places you should absolutely not miss out in India.

The exceptionally intricate architecture of the Dilwara temples are of course the main attraction here, and you can easily spend hours wondering how these temples were built over 2 centuries, almost a 1000 years back. The temples were specifically made so that they are plain from the outside to avoid attraction of plunderers, and have withstood the test of time extremely well. If architecture is not your thing, then there are various lakes and viewpoints such as the Honeymoon Point, Sunset Point, etc. Tourists enjoy calm and relaxed boating in the Nakki lake, and a view of the sunset from the Sunset point. The highest peak of the Aravali Range also lies in Mt. Abu, surrounded by dense green forests. Mt Abu will offer you all you can demand from a popular and typical destination of a romantic and simpler nature.
