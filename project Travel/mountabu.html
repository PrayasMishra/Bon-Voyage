          Located amidst the lush green Aravalli hills of Mount Abu in Rajasthan, the Dilwara Temple is the most beautiful pilgrimage site for the Jains. Designed by Vastupal Tejpal and built by Vimal Shah between the 11th and 13th century, this temple is renowned for the opulent use of marble and intricate carvings on every hook and corner. From the outside, the Dilwara Temple looks quite austere but, once you enter the inside, you will go head over heels with the stunning designs and patterns carved on roofs, walls, archways and pillars.
The Dilwara Temple includes five equally beguiling temples namely- Vimal Vasahi, Luna Vasahi, Pittalhar, Parshavanatha and Mahavir Swami Temple dedicated to Lord Adinath, Lord Rishabhdeo, Lord Neminath, Lord Mahavir Swami and Lord Parshvanath respectively. Out of these five, Vimal Vasahi and Luna Vasahi are the most famous. Each of these shrines has Rang Mandap, a central hall, Garbhagraha, the innermost sanctum where Lord resides and Navchowki, a group of nine heavily decorated ceilings. Some other spell bounding structures include Kirthi Stumbh and Hathishala. With its simplicity and austerity, Dilwara Temple tells you about Jain values and principles.

          Guru Shikhar is the highest peak of the Aravalli Range and lies about 15 kilometres from Mount Abu. The height of the peak is 1722 meters from sea level thereby promising a breathtaking view of the Aravalli range and the hill station of Mount Abu. Guru Shikhar translates to 'the peak of the guru' and was named after Guru Dattatreya who is believed to have resided on the peak during his days as a monk. The cave atop the peak has been converted to a temple in his remembrance. Guru Shikhar is also home to the Mount Abu Observatory.

After a 15 kilometre drive, you would need to climb a few steps to reach the top of Guru Shikhar Peak. When visited during October and November, the weather gets more cloudy and misty. At the top of Guru Shikhar is an age-old bell with the words '1411 AD' inscribed on it. Ringing that bell after hiking all the way to the peak is like announcing your achievement to the valley of Mount Abu. The sound of the bell chimes long and far.

It is believed that she died young as she wasn't able to marry her lover and the temple was constructed in her honour. Legend also states that the Raghunath temple in Mount Abu was built by Shri Ramanand, a 14th Century well-known Hindu scholar.

          The Honeymoon Point in Mount Abu, at an elevation of 4000 foot, offers an exquisite view of the setting sun, painting the sky yellow and red. Also known as Anadara Point, this scenic location is considered an ideal spot to unwind after a long day of travel and sightseeing. The beauty lies in the backdrop of the gorgeous Nakki Lake and the Old gateway to Mount Abu. This picturesque place is perfect to capture not only the sun shining at a distance but also to feel the brush of air while gazing at the endless horizon.

The Honeymoon Point has been named do because of the presence of two rocks at the site resembling a man and a woman. It is especially popular among couples and photographers for its ambience and panoramas. A ropeway from Bheru Taraknath Temple to Honeymoon Point has been proposed but until then foot journeys make the trip memorable and worthwhile.
