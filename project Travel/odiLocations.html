      "Rath Yatra and the Beaches"-Puri Tourism<br>Puri in Odisha is one of the four must-visit pilgrimage sites for Hindus because of Jagannath Temple that forms the part of Char Dham in India. Puri is a beach city located on the coast of Bay of Bengal which is one of the favourites among people of West Bengal for a short trip. Having gained popularity among hippies back in the 1970s due to the legalisation of Bhang, Puri is still a popular destination among backpackers, however, the availability of bhang is now limited. With a plethora of hotels and homestays, the local tourist like to stay near the New Marine Drive and the backpackers prefer to stay near Chakra Tirtha. The Rath Yatra (chariot festival) which takes place during the month of June-July should not be missed if you are planning to visit during this time. Known as the resting place of Lord Shiva, the majestic history and heritage of Puri date back to the 3rd century B. C. Puri, Konark and Bhubaneshwar complete the Golden Triangle of Orissa, with their religious significance and cultural heritage being the centres of tourism in this state. There are a lot of places near Puri that one must visit, like the Chilika lake, Puri beach, Gundicha Ghar and the very famous Sun temple of Konark. Puri is soon turning into an industrial hub with major manufacturing companies coming here.

      In the southern coastline of Odisha just 15 km from the city of Behrampur is located a quaint, tiny town of Gopalpur which was a sea port, bustling with trade and commerce, in the Colonial Era. What was once a bustling port city before being deserted, is today, one of the best beaches in the eastern coastline of the country. It is know for being an offbeat destination and a place for relaxation. The sea port remains though largely in ruins, the British have gone too but what remains is one of India's most loved beaches. The Gopalpur-on-sea is considered to be one of India's most beautiful beaches largely due to its remoteness, its peace and its offbeat crowd. The beaches are sparkling gold which along with the azure water of the Bay of Bengal providing a perfect place to relax and immerse yourself in nature. Besides the beach, the food is also pretty great in the town with many shanties providing tongue tickling sea food. Gopalpur is rapidly becoming one of the most sought after beaches in the country, with more and more people becoming aware of its beauty.

      Chandipur is a secluded seaside village of Baleshwar district stored safely on the coastline of Orissa. Chandipur is also locally known as Chandipur-on-sea. If nature's wonder fascinates you, Chandipur Beach is an amazing place to be. The unique specialty of this beach is the ebb tides that recede around 1 to 4 km during low tides and they tend to disappear rhythmically. This has a spectacular view of the rising sun and also of the sun drowning somewhere beyond waters providing feast to the eyes. When the water disappears, you can even take jeep ride towards the sea.
