        <p>Puri Beach is one of the finest coastlines in East India, bordering the Bay of Bengal and is located at a distance of 35 km from the Sun Temple. With the sun gleaming on the pristine waters of the beach, the place is ideal for holiday makers looking for some solitude. It is often flocked by devotees visiting the beach for a purification dip who come to Puri to pay their homage to Lord Jagannath. The beach is also renowned for the sand sculptures made by internationally known sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik. The sculptures are usually inspired by the art covering the temple walls or other mythological character or episode.

Adorned with fine golden sand and gushing waves, Puri Beach is quite renowned for its peaceful and calm surroundings. You can get a taste of the local life of Puri as well, as it is a favourite haunt of the natives of this place. Tourists can easily distinguish the local fishermen by their triangular straw hats and dhotis. These fishermen also serve as the lifeguards on the beach and take visitors out in the sea on their boats to look at the mesmerising sunset. The stretch on the Chakratirtha side is much more tranquil and pleasant for a long stroll, and if you're feeling a little adventurous you can also go into the waters for a swim.
